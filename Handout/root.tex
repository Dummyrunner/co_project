%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}

Describe in a few sentences what the paper is about and why it is interesting 
to read it.

\end{abstract}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{INTRODUCTION}

Some general introducing sentences about the topic, motivation and relevance of problem/algorithm.

In this paper we give an introduction to the results presented in paper(s) \cite{Bro-14}.

We present the problem statement (optimization problem)
the main results/algorithms, discuss the underlying ideas and illustrate the results 
by numerical simulations.

Notation. Define notation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT AND BACKGROUND}

Provide a mathematical problem description. If necessary, some background material.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{MAIN RESULTS}

Present main theorems/algorithm. Explain idea, explain algorithm, 
provide a convergence proof, discuss main properties (advantages and disadvantages)
\begin{algorithm}
	keks
\end{algorithm}
Use algorithm environment in Latex to present algorithm (pseudo-code)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{EXAMPLES}

Show and discuss simulation examples etc....



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{CONCLUSIONS}

Summarize the main points (with more details than in the preceding introduction).
The paper should not be between 4 and 8 pages.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{APPENDIX}

Add for example your Matlab code here. (Code should be nicely formated and documented).

Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.
