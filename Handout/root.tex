\section{INTRODUCTION}

Some general introducing sentences about the topic, motivation and relevance of problem/algorithm.

In this paper we give an introduction to the results presented in paper(s) \cite{Bro-14}.



We present the problem statement (optimization problem)
the main results/algorithms, discuss the underlying ideas and illustrate the results 
by numerical simulations.

Notation. Define notation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT AND BACKGROUND}
For theoretical discussions, we consider the convex constrained optimization problem
\begin{equation}
\OptProblem
\label{eq:OptProblem}
\end{equation}
with $ f_0:\Rn \longrightarrow \R $ convex and twice differentiable, $ f_i:\Rn \longrightarrow \R $ for $ i=1,\dots,m $ convex and twice \todo differentiable,
%TODO twice diffable necc. for fi?
$ \Aeq \in \R^{n\times p}, \beq \in  \R^p $ with equality and inequality constraints.
Moreover, we give a \matlab-implementation of a primal-dual interiorpoint method for a convex quadratic optimization problem. Quadratic problems are a subclass of \eqref{eq:OptProblem} and denote as
\begin{equation}
	\OptProblemquad
	\label{eq:QuadProblem}
\end{equation}
with matrices $ 0 \prec Q\in \R^{n \times n}, c\in \Rn. $

\section{MAIN RESULTS}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{EXAMPLES}

Show and discuss simulation examples etc....



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{CONCLUSIONS}

Summarize the main points (with more details than in the preceding introduction).
The paper should not be between 4 and 8 pages.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

\section*{APPENDIX}

Add for example your Matlab code here. (Code should be nicely formated and documented).

Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.
